Problem: 1/200 developers are low vision or blind, and use screen readers which solely read text left to right out loud. This is a time consuming process and often leads to lack of productivity.  

Solution: Google Chrome extension to make an interactive screen reader which only reads you keywords that you are looking for. 

Example Use Case: user (developer with impaired vision) is on GitHub and wants to know the latest commit that was made, and also which branch he is on. Chrome extension is always listening when enabled and is triggered by keywords "branch" and "latest commit"
